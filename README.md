# Book-Search
Book search program for CIS 227

TODO:

1. After search for a book, typing 'back' does not actually immediately bring you to the main menu. I found that pressing 'enter' multiple times brings you back to the main menu.

2. Correct SQL code for the ISBN search in the database when the user selects search book by ISBN. It currently prompts an error.

3. When the user selects "Display the book list" we get a null pointer error thrown. This needs to be corrected.

4. When the user selects the Author method of searching for a book, once the search completes, it prompts to enter an ISBN to buy. The user has to press 'enter' twice to bring the next prompt up. This should be a single 'enter'. After it asks how many would you like to buy, it gives an SQL error.

5. The "Add a book to the shopping list" requires the user to enter far too much information about the book; it should only ask for an ISBN and quantity they would like to purchase, not just that, but it currently just doesn't work after you enter the information.

6. "View the shopping list" just brings up the regular list menu, which most options do not work. When You Enter '5' to Exit, it prompts you with an error and says that it is not a valid choice even though it is listed.

7. When you log into the admin functions, and choose to change a user's password, it does not take any input and prompts you that "" does not exist. Then you press enter and it closes.

2/26 Update:

Searchbooks function needs to be reworked and a searchbookshandler needs to be added. The code needs to be rearranged as well so that the searchbook function can use some of the functions it's trying to use.


There are probably more bugs, but that is what I found for today 02/22/2023
