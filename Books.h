/**************************************************************************

readBooks - This function reads the books data from a csv file named books.csv and stores the information in the books vector.

This function uses an ifstream object named booksFile to open the file
named books.csv. The file is read line by line using the getline function
and each line is stored in the variable named line.
The function then uses the find function to locate the positions of the
commas in each line. These positions are stored in the variables i1, i2,
i3, i4 and i5.

A Book object named book is then created and the values of ISBN, title,
author, publisher, year and description are extracted from the line string
and stored in the book object. This process is done using stringstream and
the substr function.

Finally, the book object is added to the books vector. This process is
repeated until all the lines in the file have been read.
Once all the books have been added to the books vector, the booksFile
object is closed and the function returns.

The readBooks function assumes that the books.csv file exists and is
formatted correctly. If the file does not exist or if the format is
incorrect, the function will produce unexpected results.
